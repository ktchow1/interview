#include<iostream>
#include<tuple>

// Unlike index sequence, tuple does have members, it is meanful to instantiate objects of it.
// Apart from reversing tuple type, we can create reversed tuple object, the implementation can be :
//
// 1. making use of what we did
// 2. making use of index sequence



// Implement tuple_size
// Implement tuple_element
// Implement tuple_cat
